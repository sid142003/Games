    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Hotel Manager Dash! Here's how you can manage your hotel and maximize your income:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Add Guests:</strong> Click the 'Add Guest' button to add a new guest. If all rooms are occupied, and you have enough income, a new room will be created automatically.</li>
        <li><strong>Drag and Drop:</strong> Drag guests to any available room. Remember, guests prefer the room type they've chosen (normal or upgraded).</li>
        <li><strong>Upgrade Rooms:</strong> Click on a normal room to upgrade it for a fee. Upgraded rooms generate more income.</li>
        <li><strong>Income and Expansion:</strong> Each guest increases your income. Use your income wisely to upgrade rooms and expand your hotel by adding new rooms when necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Timer:</strong> You have 2 minutes in each round to earn as much as you can. The game offers 3 rounds, and your highest income will be recorded.</li>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Try to maximize your income and the number of rooms during the given time. Can you become the ultimate hotel magnate?</li>
